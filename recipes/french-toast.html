            French Toast is not from France.Legend has it that a man named Joseph French from the U.S. created the sweet breakfast
            dish in 1724 and named it after himself. However, that's probably not true: People were frying milk- and egg-soaked
            bread in Ancient Rome, according to early recipes.
